## My name is Oyindamola Tomoye

I currently work as a **data analyst** in IHS Towers Nigeria where I analyze data related to Fixed asset management, Supply chain, and general company operations. In my daily tasks, I use data to tell stories, answer business questions, and optimize business processes.

I am currently learning for my Microsoft Power BI Data analyst certification. I am also looking to collaborate with enthusiastic data analysts working on projects that deal with data from healthcare, finance, supply chain/logistics, manufacturing, and so on.

I am super excited to connect with other data professionals!
